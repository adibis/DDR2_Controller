# $DENALI/.denalirc:  System 'initialization' file for Memory Modeler.

# The '.denalirc' file is used to control Memory Modeler behavior 
# during batch and simulation runs. Up to four '.denalirc' files are 
# consulted during a simulation run, listed below in increasing order 
# of precedence.  For example, if you want to change 'just one' flag, 
# create a ./.denalirc file in the working directory of your simulation
# with that flag set how you want it.
#
# 1) '$DENALI/.denalirc'  - system defaults
# 2) '~/.denalirc'        - user defaults
# 3) './.denalirc'        - specific simulation defaults
# 4) $DENALIRC            - ENV variable which can be set to a file to 
#                           load simulation settings
####### PureSpec for PCI Express Specific flags #################
#

#################################################################
# PcieAutoExitHotReset 1
#
# If this flag is present and is 0, then ports which have entered 
# HotReset due to receiving TS1s with the HotReset bit set (they 
# were not directed by a higher layer) will wait for ttoHotReset 
# before exiting the HotReset state. If this flag is not present, 
# or if it is present and is set to 1, the ports that have not been 
# directed to HotReset will exit HotReset when ElectricalIdle is 
# detected on all RX lanes (indicating that the device at the other 
# end has entered the Detect state.)

#################################################################
# PcieAutoExitDetectQuiet 1
# PcieAutoExitDetectQuietInst 1
#
# If this flag exists in the .denalirc and is set to 0, then the model 
# instance will not automatically exit Detect.Quiet, but will always 
# wait for the ttoDetectQuiet timeout.  If this flag exists and is 
# set to 1, the model instance will exit Detect.Quiet automatically 
# after the ttxIdleMin has expired, without waiting for ttoDetectQuiet.
# The default behavior (if the flag does not exist) is that the 
# downstream port of the Root Complex model instance will exit 
# Detect.Quiet automatically, and all upstream ports will wait for 
# either ttoDetectQuiet or for electrical idle to be broken.

# PciePhyScrambleData 1
#
# Enable(1) or Disable (0) Data Scrambling.	

# PciePhyLogScrambledData 0
#
# In the debug RX/TX trace messages in the history file (if HistoryDebug 
# is enabled) display the RX/TX data symbols in their scrambled form, 
# as they actually appear on the link.	

# PciePhyBypassTraining	COM/SKP
#
# When set, bypass the physical link training and initialize the model 
# with the link in the L0 state.	
# DEFAULT - none

# PcieDllBypassInit 0
#
# When set to 1, the model will bypass the DL layer initialization.	

# PcieHistoryPktSize 256
# Specifies the maximum packet payload bytes in the history file.

# Can take any positive integer value.

# PcieUnknownPLValue 0	
#
# Converts Unknown (non-0/1) bit values in a payload to 0 (0), 
# 1 (1), or random (2).	

# AssertionCoverageFile	filename
#
# Setting this to a filename turns on the Assertion Coverage and 
# outputs the Coverage Statistics at the end of simulation to this file.
# If set to "off" or not included in the .denalirc file, 
# the simulation will not use Assertion Coverage. 	

# AssertionPassMessages 0
#
# Setting this to 1 will enable history messages to be displayed for each 
# passed Assertion Check..This is ignored if AssertionCoverageFile is 
# absent or set to off.	

# AssertionPassCallbacks 0
#
# Setting this to 1, will enable callbacks to be generated for each 
# passed Assertion. This is ignored if AssertionCoverageFile is 
# absent or set to off.	

# LogUncoveredAssertions 0
#
# Setting this to 1, will include all assertion types, not just those 
# that pass and fail, in the assertion coverage log. This will also 
# include a count of assertions not covered. 	

# AssertionChecklistFile filename
# 
# Setting this to a filename outputs the coverage statistics to the
# specified file, sorted by reference ID (e.g. PCISIG ID) instead of
# by error ID. AssertionCoverageFile must also be included in the 
# .denalirc file, and filename must be different than the filename 
# specified for AssertionCoverageFile.

# AssertionCoverageByTest 0
#
# When set to 1, the results for each puresuite test are output to

# If AssertionCoverageByTest is also set to 1, the Coverage and 
# Checklist files have the results for each test, followed by the
# summary results.

# PcieTransLogFile filename
#
# Setting this value to a filename will turn on the transaction log output.	

# PcieTransLogTypes string
#
# Setting this value to tlp, dllp,. or os will limit the output

####### Explanation of .denalirc switches you should know about ########

# Use HistoryFile to create a history file containing all read and write 
# operations to each memory.  Also, this file will record other memory
# actions and commands.  By default, no history file is created.  
# Setting it to "off" disables the history file generation.
#
# Use HistoryDebug to save extra debug information to the HistoryFile.  
# Use HistoryDebugLoad to save each individual address load to file;
# use of this switch will greatly increase the size of the HistoryFile.  
# By default, both Debug options are Off.

# HistoryFile      test.his
#default setting below
# HistoryDebug     Off
# HistoryDebugLoad On

# Use HistoryInSimLog set to 1 to see the history messages reflected in
# wherever the output from the simulator is going (which varies by simulator)
# This interleaves Denali history with testbench output.
# The default for this is 0 (off). 
# HistoryInSimLog  0

# If TraceFile is specified, then a trace ('.trc') file is created which 
# contains all of the events on memory ports, read and writes to the 
# memories, etc.  By default, there is no trace file.
# Setting it to "off" disables the trace file generation.
#default value - None
# TraceFile test.trc


# Use 'TraceTimingChecks 1' to trace all of the timing checks performed
# during simulation. 
#default -  this option is  0 (off).

# TraceTimingChecks 0


# How many minutes to wait suspended, if a license is not available
# LicenseQueueTimeout 120
# How many seconds to wait before pingng for licenses (so that the license log file doesn't overflow)
# LicenseQueueRetryDelay 60


# Uncomment the following line to generate a simulation database at /tmp/simdbXXX
# SimulationDatabase /tmp/simdbXXX
#    where XXX is a unique number to avoid collisions with other users.
# You can specify a different database location than above if desired.
# However, for performance reasons it is strongly recommended to
# locate the database on a local disk.
# NOTE: You must turn on HistoryFile when generating a database.
#       This will be corrected in a future release.
# To turn off database generation (this is the default), use:
# SimulationDatabase Off
# To limit the database info to specified instances, use a statement like:
# SimulationDatabasePattern instance2

# Turn simdb buffering off if you want database flushed to disk immediately.
# This results in a performance hit but is useful if you're debugging an, er
# "abnormal termination" situation.
# SimulationDatabaseBuffering on/off


# Use 'TimingChecks 1' to turn on timing checks (default). 
# Use 'TimingChecks 0' to turn off timing checks (setup, hold, etc).
#default value is 1 (on). 

# TimingChecks 1


# Use 'RefreshChecks 1' to turn on refresh checking for DRAMs. 
# Use 'RefreshChecks 0' to turn off refresh checking. 
# If you don't have any DRAMs in your design, this check is ignored.

# RefreshChecks 1

#
# If you'd like to count reads and writes as a refresh to that particular row,
# set the following parameter RefreshOnReadWrite to 1
#
# Although the true behavior of the part may count a read and
# write as a refresh to that row, Denali doesn't default to that
# behavior because we feel a controller shouldn't rely on certain
# memory accesses to obtain proper refresh rates.
#  This is supported for edram, rldram, sdram, ddr sdram, and
#  ddr II sdram memories.

# RefreshOnReadWrite 0

#
# If you'd like to have the model check for bus contention on DQS during 
# reads, set ReadDQSContentionCheck 1. Supported for ddr and ddr_II models only.

#
# DDR/DDR_II SDRAM models checks for bus contention on DQS during 
# reads. To disable this check, set ReadDQSContentionCheck 0.

# ReadDQSContentionCheck 0

#
# DDR and DDR2 SDRAM models check for twpst_max violations only if 
# (a) the next command is not a write, or 
# (b) there is more than one cycle between the end of the last data burst 
#     and the start of the next one.  
# To disable the twpst_max check for case (b), set TwpstMaxAtBusTurnaroundOnly 1.

# TwpstMaxAtBusTurnaroundOnly 1

#######################################################################
# IBM-EDRAM Specific Check
#
# Use 'SuppressRefreshInfoMessages 1' to eliminate informational messages 
# about the actual refresh window size (when it's not an error or warning)
# The default is '0', or to report on every refresh cycle.  

# SuppressRefreshInfoMessages 0 



# By default, memory is initialized to 'X'. To change the default, you 
# may specify:
#   InitialMemoryValue 0  - for all '0's
#   InitialMemoryValue 1  - for all '1's
#   InitialMemoryValue X  - for all 'X's
#   InitialMemoryValue U  - for all 'U's
#
# or, alternatively, a hex value to initialize all the words to. This value
# must begin with "0x" and consist of the hex values 0-9 and A-F (or a-f)
# an example is:  
#   InitialMemoryValue  0x3018
# This string cannot expand to be longer than the memory's word width 
# (typically the data size).  If shorter, the unspecified bits will be filled
# with 0s. 
#   
# Any other value will initialize memory to all 'X's
#
# You may also generate random data for the initial data by specifying:
#
#   InitialMemoryValue randomNoUpdate - the model is not updated with the 
#             random data, it is not written to the model.   So subsequent
#             reads without intervening writes will get new random data.
#   InitialMemoryValue randomWithUpdate  - the model is updated with the
#             random data, it is written to the model.  So subsequent reads
#             without intervening writes will get the same random data that
#             was returned the first time
#
# Alternatively, you can use any arbitrary C function to specify the initial
# data, including random data, random data with parity, etc.   
# See $DENALI/ddvapi/example/fillValue for examples. 

# InitialMemoryValue X


# By default, the system will report an informative message concerning
# each memory component instantiated in your design.  
# Use InitMessages Off to turn off these messages.
#default value is on.

# InitMessages Off


# Trace based on instance name pattern, may use shell "glob" patterns
# for example, *, ?, [].
# default - All instances
# TracePattern  instance2

# Recording history for instances matching pattern
#default - All instances
# HistoryPattern instance2

###################################
# In models with random output delay scheduling, such as DDR SDRAM, DDR-II, 
# FCRAM, RDRAM, and RLDRAM, output scheduling and some timing checks are 
# affected by the actual clock cycle time. The clock cycle time is typically
# measured by the model during the first few cycles of simulation only, 
# unless one of the following flags is used.
#
# Running uneven clocks (non-constant clock width) or not. When this is set, 
# the model measures the clock width every cycle and disables random output 
# delay scheduling.
# IrregularClock 0
#
# If there are only irregular clocks at the beginning of simulation,
#   you can use the feature 
# ClockStableCycles xxx 
#   where xxx is the number of cycles in a row where we will consider clock
#   stablilized.  
#

# In models with random output delay scheduling, which better exercises
# the memory controller, you might want to turn it off early in your 
# verification cycle.  This can be accomplished by setting RandomOutputDelay
# to 0.  This has no effect if IrregularClock is 1.
# RandomOutputDelay 1


# By default, the memory model drives output with delay, if setting to 0,
# then it drives output with zero delay, mainly used for cycle-based 
# simulation.
# OutputTiming 1

# When RandomOutputDelay is 0 and IrregularClock is 0, the model does not do
# random output scheduling, but it does take the clock high and low pulse
# widths into account, so this mode can be used when the clock duty cycle is 
# not 50%. The MinimumOutputDelay flag is used in this mode only. If 
# MinimumOutputDelay is set to 1, the outputs are scheduled as early as 
# possible; otherwise, the outputs are scheduled as late as possible.
# Typical usage would be to do two runs, one with this flag set to 0 and one
# with it set to 1.
# Currently only implemented for DDR SDRAM.
# MinimumOutputDelay 0

# ErrorCount variable.
# In Verilog code, you can use an integer variable to see the number
# of errors detected by the Denali memory models.  Declare an
# integer variable in your testbench and then register it as the
# error count variable through the ErrorCount switch in the .denalirc file.
# Then our models will increment this variable each time an error detected.
# You may monitor the error count variable, branch on it, etc. Sample usage:
#
# In testbench:
#
# module testbench;
#   integer errCount;     // monitor, display this
#
# In .denalirc: uncomment the following line:
# No default value.
# ErrorCount testbench.errCount

# This variable gives you the option of exiting simulation when Denali errors
# occur.  If this is 0, it won't exit, a positive number means to exit when
